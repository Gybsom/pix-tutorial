# Key types

To make the process of sending and receiving money simpler and safer, you can register a PIX key. Those keys are the codes that serve as a representation of an account. An account can have multiple keys (up to 5) linked to it, but a key can only reference one account.

The keys are stored in the Directory of Transactional Account Identifiers (DICT) and serve to link this code to the user's complete transactional account information.

### There are five types of PIX keys, which are:

Type | Description
-------- | -----
Cell phone number | The cell phone will use the E.164 standard.
Email address | Email with a maximum length of 77 characters.
CPF | CPF containing the 11 numbers, including the verification digits. It must be informed without dots or dashes.
CNPJ | CPF containing the 14 numbers, including the verification digits. It must be informed without dots or dashes.
Random Key | UUID generated by DICT.
