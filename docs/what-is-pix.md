Pix is the Brazilian instant payment system regulated by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), designed to be a secure and agile payment system to serve individuals and businesses. The model allows you to make transfers, pay bills, collect taxes and service fees. Its engine is the Instant Payment System (SPI), which is responsible for ensuring Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS).


A PIX payment can be initiated in 3 different ways:
-   Using a key
-   Using bank details
-   Using a QR Code
