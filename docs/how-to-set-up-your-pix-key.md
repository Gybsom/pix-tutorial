# How to set up your PIX key

To register a new PIX key, access the *PIX area*, available in the main menu of your app, and click on the option *my keys*. Then, select the option *register key* and choose the desired key type. If the type of key chosen in the registration is the cell phone or e-mail, a validation step will be performed, by sending a verification code. After validation, the key will be ready to use.

**Important**: it is possible to register up to 5 keys in an account and it is not possible to use the same key in more than one account.
